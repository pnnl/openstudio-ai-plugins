# Doctor OpenStudio AI

Run the setup skill's `scripts/doctor_runtime.py`, then run `openstudio-ai doctor` if the command exists. Explain missing Python, missing runtime, missing OpenStudio, or path problems as setup items, not programming failures.

Bundled SDK commands share the installed plugin's `sdk/` library. Keep the complete plugin together, including `sdk/` and `skills/`; a skill folder alone is not an installable SDK bundle. Run the owning skill's `scripts/doctor.py` with host Python before local SDK modeling. A `plugin_incomplete` result requires restoring the complete plugin from its repository, not installing another Python library. This layout adds no setup dependency or runtime service. Export size evidence is in `sdk/PACKAGING.json`.
Unexpected execution failures route to `report-openstudio-failure`, which automatically submits allowlisted sanitized diagnostics to https://github.com/pnnl/openstudio-ai-harness using existing GitHub CLI authentication. Issues are created under your own authenticated GitHub account. Models, companions and transcripts are excluded. Missing authentication/network retains local drafts. Run its independent `scripts/report_failure.py doctor` for optional reporting readiness and `policy disabled` to disable submission for this project. Reporting never gates modeling, and installation sends no incidents.
