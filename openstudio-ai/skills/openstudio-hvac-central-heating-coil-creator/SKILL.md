description: Create the central heating coil for an OpenStudio VAV air loop, with water/gas/electric options.
version: 0.2.1
output_format: markdown_with_json_state_patch
---

## Scope

Use this child skill to create the central heating coil upstream of the VAV air
loop. It supports hot-water, gas, electric, and explicit no-heat choices.

Do not create the air loop, the fan, the cooling coil, the outdoor-air system, zone reheat coils, simulations, result queries in this skill.

## Required State Fields

- `current_model_path`
- `output_model_path`
- `created_objects.air_loop`
- `central_heating.type`
- `completed_steps`
- `pending_steps`



Conditional required fields:

- `central_heating.hot_water_loop_name` when `central_heating.type` is `Water`
- converted design temperatures when water-coil rated air temperatures are set



## Optional State Fields

- `central_heating.coil_name`
- `central_heating.rated_inlet_water_temperature_c`
- `central_heating.rated_outlet_water_temperature_c`
- `central_heating.rated_inlet_air_temperature_c`
- `central_heating.rated_outlet_air_temperature_c`
- `warnings`


## SDK Methods To Verify

- `CoilHeatingWater.new`
- `CoilHeatingGas.new`
- `CoilHeatingElectric.new`
- `PlantLoop.addDemandBranchForComponent`
- `HVACComponent.addToNode`
- `AirLoopHVAC.supplyInletNode`
- water-coil rated inlet/outlet water and air temperature setters supported by the active OpenStudio version


## Code Pattern

1. Load `current_model_path` and find the air loop.
2. If type is `Water`, find the named hot-water plant loop, derive loop design
   exit temperature and delta-T when possible, create `CoilHeatingWater`, add it
   to the loop demand side, then add it to the air-loop supply inlet node.
   
3. If type is `NaturalGas` or `Gas`, create `CoilHeatingGas` and add it to the
   air-loop supply inlet node.
   
4. If type is `Electricity`, create `CoilHeatingElectric` and add it to the
   air-loop supply inlet node.
   
5. If type is `None`, create nothing and record the approved no-heat state.
6. Save and return created coil and loop attachment details.


## Missing Field Behavior

If a water coil is requested without `central_heating.hot_water_loop_name`, ask
which existing hot-water plant loop should serve the coil.

Do not create a plant loop in this child skill.

## State Patch

Return only changed fields:

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "state_patch": {
    "current_model_path": "/path/to/output.osm",
    "completed_steps": [
      "central_heating_coil"
    ],
    "pending_steps_remove": [
      "central_heating_coil"
    ],
    "central_heating": {
      "type": "Water",
      "coil_name": "3 Zone VAV Main Htg Coil",
      "hot_water_loop_name": "Hot Water Loop"
    },
    "created_objects": {
      "central_heating_coil": "3 Zone VAV Main Htg Coil"
    },
    "warnings": []
  }
}
```

## Validation Checks

- Requested heating-coil type was created exactly once, or no coil was created only when `None` was approved.
- Water coil is attached to the named plant loop demand side.
- Coil is added to the target air-loop supply inlet node.
